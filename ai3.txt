ASSIGNMENT 3 - AI 2014

Some ideas:

We need to get those letters scanned soon.

We should be able to detect:
-Horizontal lines
-Vertical lines
-Diagonal lines
-Curved lines(the quarter of a circle?)

The program should be able to describe the letter like..

Two diagonal lines meeting at the bottom = V

Two diagonal lines meeting on top
+
a line between the two diagonal lines = A

4 curved lines meeting on top = O
(or 1 line with 4 sections)

6 curved lines = S


6 curved lines, one ending in middle = G

3 horizontal lines, 1 vertical = E


and so on..


A=3
B=5
C=1
D=2
E=4
F=3
G=3?
..and we shoudl probably collect most data from training.
